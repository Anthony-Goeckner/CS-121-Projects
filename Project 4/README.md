## Overview

Manages game state information and logic for a game of TicTacToe.

## Reflection

I found this open-ended project to be quite a bit more challenging than 
the normal projects done up to this point. However, it was also much more 
satisfying to complete. I struggled quite a bit in the beginning, even
completely starting over once, but managed to get it solved.
I found that it worked best to work through the failed test from the tester
from the top to the bottom. Going this way meant I worked with the simpler 
errors, and not as much game data to go through by hand to find the bugs. 

## Compiling and Using

To run this program, the TicTacToe.java interface is necessary, as well as
either the TicTacToeGUI.java or the TicTacToeTester.java; all of these must
be in the same directory. While in that directory, in the command line, type
$ javac *.java
to compile all of the files. Next, you run either the GUI or the Tester class
using the line
$ java TicTacToeGUI
or
$ java TicTacToeTester
