# Project 2: Jukebox Hero

* Author: Anthony Goeckner
* Class: CS121 Section 005
* Semester: Fall 2021

## Overview

Gives the user an interface with which to load a CSV file of songs, and
options to print the whole contents of the CSV, analyse the CSV, and
search for specific songs

## Reflection

At first I did not realize there was extra credit, and was using static
functions for the printing CSVs, and for printing arrays, to not have to 
reuse code. When I realized that was extra credit, I was proud that I
did it without knowing. Adding Javadoc comments was a bit more time 
consuming, as I added them all afterwards.



## Compiling and Using

Before compiling this code, ensure that JukeboxHero.java and Song.java 
are in the same directory, as well as the csv file of songs. To compile
the files, use the line
$ javac JukeboxHero.java Song.java
Then to run the file, use the line
$ java JukeboxHero
The program will then print out a menu. From there, you can follow the 
directions on screen.
