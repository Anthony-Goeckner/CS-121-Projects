# Project 0: Traffic Animation

* Author: Anthony Goeckner

## Overview

This Java application displays an animated car driving along a background.

## Reflection

There were a few parts of this project that I found challenging. Learning to use an array for a polygon was a bit tricky, but looking at the documentation and an online guide, I was able to figure it out. Another challenge was figring out how to make the array scale with the window size.

Learning to set the colors was a bit difficult. I am grateful that we have resources online to not have to guess and check the RGB values.

## Copmpiling and Using

To compile, execute the following command in the main directory:
```
$ javac TrafficAnimation.java
```

Run the compiled class with the command:
```
$ java TrafficAnimation
```

The program should open a new window presenting the animation
